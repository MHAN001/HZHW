		<h2>Fú Characters:</h2>
		
		 <p>a very common decoration during the Chinese Spring Festival is the “Fú (福)” character, which means good fortune in Chinese. A square of red paper adorned with the Fú character is pasted to the outer side of the door to one’s home, and sometimes the character is also used to adorn interior doors. While in the past the decoration usually consisted of a red square of paper with black-colored calligraphy, many modern version are much more elaborate and use a golden color for the character, and are decorated with other characters from cartoons or the zodiac animal of the current year. In addition, a tradition practiced in some, but not all, regions in China is to paste the Fú character upside down. In Chinese the word for upside down,”dǎo (倒),” sounds similar to the word for arrive, “dào (到).” Thus, pasting the character upside down implies that good fortune has, or will arrive.</p>

		<h2>Paper Cutting</h2>
		<div class = "inner">
			
			<p> Paper cutting is a traditional Chinese craft commonly seen during the Spring Festival. The cutting of designs and patterns supposedly began thousands of years ago as a way to worship the gods, and the tradition is said to have begun prior even to the invention of paper. During the Chinese Spring Festival, some of the most common designs are the Fú character, fish, and the zodiac animal of the current year. Paper cuttings are also commonly found at weddings and other types of Chinese celebrations. The material used in this craft is almost always the color red.</p>

		<h2>Share</h2>
		<p>Couplets: couplets, or “duì lián (对联)” in Chinese, consist of two vertical strips usually comprising 7-11 characters, and sometimes a third horizontal strip comprising 4 characters. Duì lián are intended as permanent fixtures adorning the outer gates of a home and can embody one’s hope with regard to a number of different themes including prosperity, peace, success, among others. “Chūn lián,” by contrast are a non-permanent version displayed before, during, and after the Chinese Spring Festival. Red strips of paper are used, with characters written in black or gold ink.</p>
